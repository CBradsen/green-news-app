To retreive WORLD green energy news the Everything end point is used.
It also includes a search for energy AND (solar OR wind OR clean OR green OR "climate change").
It limits the scope of publications to bbc.co.uk, reuters.com, aljazeera.com, and thenextweb.com
This allows for a high quality of returns. 

The USA query includes the same search words and focuses on US media publications:
<br>
washingtonpost.com, denverpost.com, latimes.com, and usatoday.com

## Accessability
The font Lato was chosen from Google Fonts and used exclusively.

<br>
In a Lighthouse review the site recieved an 8/9.
This was not 9/9 due to using smaller headline sizes at the top of the page.
Future iterations could remedy this, so that screen readers could best serve visitors to the site.

## Process
Experimenting with the api and it's possibilities began my UX Design process. 
<br>
I wanted to find a niche that had value to potential users and something I cared about.
<br>
After settling on Green Energy news, I:
<br>
- researched other online news sites
- drew lofi wireframes
- created a user persona
- wrote user stories
- kept prject notes in a Notion page
- created a list of project tasks with a [github project board](https://github.com/users/CBradsen/projects/2)
